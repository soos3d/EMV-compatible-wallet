# Simple EMV wallet

Example of a simple wallet written in Solidity, and it includes events to keep track of what happens.

## Logic behind this project. 

The purpose is to learn some Solidity, web3.py, web3.js, Ethers.js by creating your own wallet deployed on a blockchain. 

This smart contract allows you to:
- Store tokens in it (native tokens out of the box).
- Withdraw tokens from its balance.
- See the contract balance.
- Emit events to display additional data on the front-end.

There are a few ways to use a smart contract like this, and we will see three.

1. Programmatically, by using a script, Web3.py and web3.js in this case 
    - Note that this method is not the most practical, but it's an excellent way to learn how to use those libraries.
1. Develop a front-end, using MetaMask and Ethers.js.
1. Using a development framework, Ape by ApeWorX in this case.
